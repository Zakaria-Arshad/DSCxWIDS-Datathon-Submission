Dataset: Well-Being and Basic Needs Survey, United States, 2020 (ICPSR 38388)

Brief overview of dataset: The Urban Institute initiated the Well-Being and Basic Needs Survey (WBNS) in December 2017, which is an online survey that targets non-elderly adults from all over the US. Its main objective is to observe changes in individual and family well-being while policymakers are considering alterations to federal safety net programs aimed at low-income families. In 2020, the survey gathered data on various aspects related to health, material hardship, and safety net programs, including health insurance, housing, food security, employment, family income, program participation, family financial security, disability, school enrollment, child care, COVID-19 vaccine attitudes, the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on family employment, and immigration matters.

Attached is our analysis of the dataset through visualization and modeling. Packages used include seaborn, numpy, matplotlib, pandas, and scikit-learn. Used techniques such as SMOTE for imbalanced data, k-means clustering, and k-nearest neighbors to model and better visualize data.

Also attached is a brief presentation outlining our goals for the project.
